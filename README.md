#### Not really a social media site


#### Key changes to standard social media model:

No addictive infinite scroll.
- How many posts do you want to scroll for? Use our service, and get back to living your life. 
- Max 50 posts, you can define the number of posts you view whenever you log in.
- Maybe a timer.

No like buttons. 
- Only comments.

No data trading/harvesting.
- Advertising - if we get that far - will be curated, not targeted.

#### To run on your machine:

```
npm i mongoose showdown express nodemon 
```
#### Markdown cheatsheet for posts:

\<del><del>text here</del>\</del>

\# # header text here \## ## smaller header text here \### ### even smaller header text here
