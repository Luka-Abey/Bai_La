### Not really a social media site


### Key changes to standard social media model:

No addictive infinite scroll.
- How many posts do you want to scroll for? Use our service, and get back to living your life. 
- Max 50 posts, you can define the number of posts you view whenever you log in.
- Maybe a timer.

No like buttons. 
- Only comments.

No data trading/harvesting.
- Advertising - if we get that far - will be curated, not targeted.

### To set up on your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Luka-Abey/socialLife.git
```
```
npm i
```
```
cd client && npm i
```
```
cd ..
```
```
npm run dev
```
runs both the server and client concurrently
