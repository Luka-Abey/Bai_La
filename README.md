#### Not really a social media site


#### Key changes to standard social media model:

No addictive infinite scroll.
- How many posts do you want to scroll for? Use our service, and get back to living your life. 
- Max 50 posts, you can define the number of posts you view whenever you log in.
- Maybe a timer.

No like buttons. 
- Only comments.

No data trading/harvesting.
- Advertising - if we get that far - will be curated, not targeted.
